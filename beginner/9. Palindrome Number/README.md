# Intuition:

- The function aims to determine if the input integer `x` is a palindrome or not.

# Approach: 

- Check if `x` is negative or ends with a zero (excluding zero itself), in which case it cannot be a palindrome.
- Initialize two variables `original` and `reversed` to store the original value of `x` and the reversed version, respectively.
- Loop through the digits of `x` and construct the reversed number by multiplying `reversed` by 10 and adding the last digit of `x` to it. Remove the last digit from `x` in each iteration.
- After the loop, compare `original` and `reversed`. If they are equal, return `true`, indicating that `x` is a palindrome; otherwise, return `false`.

# Time Complexity: 

$$O(log10(x))$$:

- The time complexity of the function is O(log10(x)) because the loop runs for approximately log10(x) iterations, where x is the input number.

# Space Complexity:

$$O(1)$$

- The space complexity of the function is O(1) as it only uses a constant amount of extra space for variables (`original` and `reversed`).

# Code
```
func isPalindrome(x int) bool {
    if (x < 0) || (x % 10 == 0 && x != 0) {
        return false
    }

    original := x
    reversed := 0

    for x > 0 {
        reversed = reversed*10 + (x % 10)
        x = x / 10
    }

    return original == reversed
}
```
